# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
By doing this analysis, I will be helping an up-and-coming playwright, Louise, who wants to start a crowdfunding campaign to help fund her play, *Fever*. She's aiming to fund a budget of over $10,000 and I will provide insights on the factors that make a funding campaign successful. 


## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
From the theatre outcome based on launch date chart, first we can see the amount of successful campaigns keep increasing in the first half of the year and hit a crescendo in May, then start to drop.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Since Louise needs to fund over 10000, we should only look at those campaign goals that are above 10000. From the chart, we can see successful rate is higher then failed rate for goals range from 10000 to 19999. If the funding goal is higher than 20000, there will be a high risk to fail. Therefore, I recommend to set the goal below 19999.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
I found it very manual to create the outcomes based on goals table, because each cell in number of successful/failed/canceled columns has its own formula. So I created a one row table at the bottom to make the process more automatic.  


## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
Firstly, we can conclude that May is the best month of the year to launch campaign in theatre but be prepared for the fierce competition.
Secondly, usually there are more successful campaigns in theatres compared to failed ones except in December, which could be attributed to that people go for vacations in holiday.  

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
I recommend to set the goal below 19999, and above 10000 as Louise planned.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
This dataset doesn't include all the costs that each campaign has.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
We could create a chart "Play outcomes by launch date" and "Outcomes based on play length".
